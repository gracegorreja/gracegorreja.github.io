            <h1> Nights to Remember</h1>
            <p class= para1> Deep in the heart of Astoria, there’s a venue located on a secluded block with five large, yellow letters - Central - every Queens kid’s little secret. Although it may seem like your typical nightclub from the outside, all year round Central hosts unforgettable parties for all age groups. I have been attending these parties ever since I was eight, and older age brought even better parties. These events vary from annual children’s Halloween parties, where my Central memories begin, to high school extravaganzas. 
Halloween of 2014 was when every child's worst fear came true - a rainy Halloween. Frantic to fill up their jack-o-lantern baskets with candy, children were running up and down the blocks attempting to shield themselves from the pouring rain. As mothers began to pull their kids back indoors, the streets became a deserted wasteland. The joy of Halloween had disappeared in an instant. When I began to think all hope was lost, my godmother began to direct me down a foreign pathway. Before I knew it, I was standing in front of two enormous double doors, surrounded by red velvet rope and three monstrous vampire inflatables. Upon entering, the sound of the censored music flooded my ears as the colorful lights blinded my eyes. Inside, kids were dancing, parents were sitting at tables enjoying a drink, and everyone was having the time of their life. Although it would not seem very appropriate in today's society, back then clowns would be getting busy creating balloon animals and painting everyone’s face as the DJ played censored music. At the end of the night, there was a raffle for several toys and gifts, this was my highlight of the night; what child can say no to free toys.
As my friends and I got older we began to attend the parties Central hosts only sanctioned for high schoolers. I admire these parties for various reasons, one of the main being that I get to meet so many new people from different parts of the borough; this forms a sense of community where many people call home. High schoolers would commute from neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Bayside, and even Flushing just to attend. Astoria is one of the biggest melting posts in Queens and Central’s parties are a direct representation of the diversity in the area. What I mean when I say community is a place where the environment is nothing short of warm and inviting for people of all ethnic backgrounds to come together and enjoy themselves; Central is a community. All who attend come to have a good time and nothing will ruin it. Unlike the children’s Halloween parties there is no censored music, balloon animals, and face painters. However, the fog machine, laser beams, light shows, and each other’s company are always enough to provide an astonishing unforgettable experience. As everyone is getting busy on the dance floor, the smell of hamburgers and chicken wings flow through the air as the hostesses bring out the food.  Nonetheless, everyone would disregard their appetite entirely so they would not miss the next hit the DJ would play. As always this would be a bad decision resulting in everyone being completely parched by the end of the night. There comes a moment after hours of dancing where one may need to step outside for some fresh air. That first breath of fresh air in front of the red velvet rope of the building pierces through the lungs as they prepare for another round of dancing and screaming along to this year’s top hits.
            <p class= para2> One of the most eventful moments for me at Central was during Christmas of 2018. It was a cold winter night and the snow was falling heavily on the ground; everyone had just finished their yearly midterms and we were all excited to finally let loose and relax. As the DJ began to play our favorite songs no one hesitated to run on the dance floor and start the evening. An hour passed, and the fog machine, everyone's beloved contraption, still hadn't been turned on. It wasn't until the appalling sound of a motor engine crashing stopped everyone in their tracks, did we realize that the fog machine was broken. Nevertheless, no one complained or caused a scene; we were not going to let a minor glitch delay our night. We all continued to enjoy ourselves and each other's undying company, no matter how pitched our renditions of “Born in the USA'' were. The expression “time flies when you are having fun” perfectly portrays everyone’s experience at Central because it never fails to be proven otherwise. Another hour and a half pass, and the DJ is mixing “We Are Young,” when all of a sudden an immense burst of smoke shoots out of the fog machine once the beat drops. We were all in awe as the timing of this was absolutely perfect, and an astonishing way to wrap up a momentous night. This is certainly a moment of my teenage years I will hold on with me forever, and a night everyone who was in attendance will never forget..<li>
